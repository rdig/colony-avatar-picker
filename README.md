# Colony Avatar Picker

# Setup

Install the required packages using:
```bash
npm i
```

# Development

This is only made to run in development mode, and since it's using `webpack-dev-server` it will not output any file, but will serve them from memory.

The build folder is just there to hold the media files, since we are not processing them in any way with webpack.

To run just type:
```bash
npm start
```

This will start a local webserver on `http://localhost:8080/`.

# Testing

To run the unit tests just type:
```bash
npm test
```
